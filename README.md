# Intellect-Playschool-Management-System

According to the client's description, the playschool previously was managed through manual system configuration. They utilize various additional platforms, particularly emphasizing Facebook for updating all school-related activities, WhatsApp as a communication channel between teachers and guardians, and Microsoft Excel for storing comprehensive data related to the school, students, and staff.The existing system efficiently handles numerous task. As to minimize the workload of the client managing the playschool, **Intellect Smart** (the system's name) is designed to cope with the current management issue.

There are altogether three categories of users—administrator, staff, and kid's guardian—involved in this system. The **_administrator_** has overall control of the system, which includes double checking through the fee submission from the kid's guardian, salary distribution to the staff, and creating an official account for the guardians once their kids have been successfully enrolled at the playschool. The **_staffs_** can give comments, achievement level, and manner status on the assessment (V.A.K. (visual, auditory, and kinesthetic) and Multiple Intelligence observation and review) for the kids such that their guardians are able to view their kid’s assessment from time to time via the system. Staff's daily attendance can also be recorded by clocking in and out through the system. There is a provison for staffs to upload medical certificates in case of staff absence due to medical reasons.

Guardians have the option to provide advance notice of their kid's attendance, facilitating smoother preparation of meals for the kids. The system allows guardians to access announcements and activities, preventing the loss of important information.

The system is developed using the knowledge derived from the course of Database, System Analysis and Design and System Development Technology.
